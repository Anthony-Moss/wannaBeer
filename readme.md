##What It Is
---
This is a front-end web-page project that allows visiters to find breweries near their location and pull up information about them.

We built a website where users can visit to get information on breweries in the state of Georgia, it works by grabbing your current locations latitute and longitude which is used to grab the information about each brewery in your state. (Only works for Georgia for now). 

It was a fun mini project used to put the pieces of HTML and CSS and JavaScript we had learned in class together, and make a webpage. 

##What We Used
---
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * JavaScript

##Challenges and Solutions
---
As this was our first real project, we met many chanllenges along the way. The real goal for this was just to get HTML, CSS and JavaScript all working together for a static webpage using data from API's. 

1) Our biggest challenge came with using one of our APIs MapBox, while it was a wonderfully powerful API it was also quite complicated to use especially for the level we were at when we did this project. As our project really focues around a map this was crucial for us. 

There wasnt really a great solution for  this challenge in the end we just had to dive into the API's documentation and figure out how to actually use it. Most of our time for this project was really spent working on understanding how to use the Map API to display the different data we wanted. 

2) Another major problem that we faced during this project was using Github. While we had all been introduced to Github prior and had been using it on our own, none of us had experience working in groups on the same project. In a way this project really helped us with our overall understanding of Github and how to work with a team. 

To combat this problem we really had to be careful and doublecheck everything we did on Github. It was something we really just had to sort of fumble through and learn how not to do things in the future. Everytime there  was a push we all would have to sit down together to make sure everything was correctly done and there. It was a slow process, but this was extremely valiable for future projects and in the end made us all much better at using Github.


##MVP (Minimum Viable Product)
---  
The MVP for this project was pretty straight-forward, this was our first project and we quickly realized that it was not going to be as easy as we had thought, especially working with the MapBox API.

Our first MVP iteration included:
  * A main landing screen that users would see upon loading the page. 
  * A map component that would show the location of the user and have pins for breweries near them.
  * A list section that would have a list of all the breweries in your state.
  * A contents section that when either clicking the map icon or the name of a brewery from the list would show basic information about the brewery, like name, address and website.
